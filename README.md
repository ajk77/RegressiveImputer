# RegressiveImputer
Impute missing values via a regression model

## Getting Started

Run this imputer on any numpy two dimensional array. Samples must be rowwise.<br>
It is recommended that you run get_clean_columns() on your data before passing it to RegressiveImputer. If you data contains any columns that are all nan and you do not run get_clean_columns, then the columns will remain nan in the transformed dataset.<br>
This file was designed to work with data generated by PatientPy (https://github.com/ajk77/PatientPy).

## Deployment

Update file path name in PatientPyFeatureSelection.py
Run PatientPyFeatureSelection.py.<br />
